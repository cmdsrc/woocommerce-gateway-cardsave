Installation Notes
==================
This module is for WooCommerce Version 2.1.x only. It will NOT work with earlier versions of WooCommerce. WooCommerce 2.1+ requires Wordpress 3.8 - please ensure you are using this version.

This module was built on version 2.1.1, we cannot guarantee it will work on version 2.1.0. There are also various bugs in WooCommerce 2.1.0, as a result we recommend that you use WooCommerce 2.1.1 or above. 

Installation Instructions for Re-Directed Payments
==================================================
Step 1. Pre-Installation
------------------------
If you have not already done so, install WordPress, then install (and activate) WooCommerce.

If you have an earlier version of this plugin installed, you must remove it before continuing.

To remove the plugin, login to your WordPress Admin:
a) Click Plugins > Installed plugins on the left navigation.
b) Click the "Deactivate" link below the "WooCommerce CardSave Redirect Gateway" option
c) Click the check box next to "WooCommerce CardSave Redirect Gateway"
d) Using the "Bulk Actions" drop down at the top of the page, select "Delete" and click the "Apply" button.

We also advise you check the files have been correctly deleted via FTP before proceeding.

Step 2. Upload Cardsave Module files
------------------------------------
Upload the woocommerce-gateway-cardsave folder and its contents to the wp-content\plugins folder of your WordPress installation.

Step 3. Login and Configure
---------------------------
a) Login to your WordPress admin area.
b) On the left navigation, click "Plugins".
c) Click the "Activate" link under the "WooCommerce CardSave Redirect Gateway".
d) On the left navigation, select "WooCommerce" > "Settings".
e) Click the "Checkout" tab.
f) Click the "CardSave" link at the top of the page (under the menu bar).
d) Enter the following information into the boxes provided.

Title: This is name displayed alongside the payment option on the checkout page.
Description: This is shown in the box under the payment option, once it has been selected.
Merchant ID: As provided in the production/test merchant gateway emails.
Merchant Password: As set when first logging into the MMS.
Pre-shared Key: As shown under the Merchant Information section of the MMS.
"Pre-Auth" Payment Only: Tick this only if you require "Pre-Auth" only transactions to process - this will NOT collect the payment.
Accept American Express: Tick this only if you have an American Express MID associated with your CardSave gateway account.
Mandatory Fields: Tick the fields you wish to be shown as mandatory on the gateway page (we recommend all fields are marked as mandatory).

Click the "Save changes" button when you have finished.

Step 4. Testing
---------------
You should now be able to select the CardSave payment method on the payment method selection page of the checkout. 

If you are using a test gateway account, you will be able to use the test cards & addresses in the "CardSave Test Gateway Test Cards" included with this module.

NOTE: You need to use the card billing address as specified in the PDF file alongside each card - If you use the incorrect billing address, as default, the payment will fail (AVS/Postcode Check will fail).
