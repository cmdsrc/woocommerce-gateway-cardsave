Installation Instructions for Re-Directed Payments
==================================================
Step 1. Pre-Installation
------------------------
If you have not already done so, install WordPress, then install (and activate) WooCommerce.

Step 2. Upload Cardsave Module files
------------------------------------
Upload the woocommerce-gateway-cardsave folder and its contents to the wp-content\plugins folder of your WordPress installation.

Step 3. Login and Configure
---------------------------
a) Login to your WordPress admin area.
b) on the left navigation, click "Plugins".
c) click the "Activate" link under the "WooCommerce CardSave Redirect Gateway".
d) on the left navigation, select "WooCommerce" > "Settings".
e) Click the "Payment Gateways" tab.
f) Click the "CardSave" tab.
d) Click the tick alongside the "Cardsave Redirect" option, and click the "Update" button under the list of gateways.
e) on the right hand column, using the "Payment Gateway" drop down menu, select "Cardsave Redirect". Enter the following information into the boxes provided.

Title: This is name displayed alongside the payment option on the checkout page.
Description: This is shown in the box under the module, once it has been selected.
Merchant ID: As provided in the production/test merchant gateway emails.
Merchant Password: As set when first logging into the MMS.
Pre-shared Key: As shown under the Merchant Information section of the MMS.
"Pre-Auth" Payment Only: Tick this only if you require "Pre-Auth" only transactions to process - this will NOT collect the payment.
Accept American Express: Tick this only if you have an American Express MID associated with your CardSave gateway account.
Mandatory Fields: Tick the fields you wish to be shown as mandatory on the gateway page (we recommend all fields are marked as mandatory).

Click the "Save changes" button when you have finished.

Step 4. Testing
---------------
You should now be able to select the CardSave payment method on the payment method selection page of the checkout. 

If you are using a test gateway account, you will be able to use the test cards & addresses in the "CardSave Test Gateway Test Cards" included with this module.

NOTE: You need to use the card billing address as specified in the PDF file alongside each card - If you use the incorrect billing address, as default, the payment will fail (AVS/Postcode Check will fail).
